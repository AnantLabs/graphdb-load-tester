#summary Introducing the graphdb-load-tester project

= Background to this project =

While graph databases promise lots of benefits once data is loaded into them I have been frustrated by their ability to load large volumes of data. This project is intended to highlight (and hopefully solve these issues) through using a large publicly available data set -the Wikipedia links data. 
== Why Wikipedia? ==
The Wikipedia links data is a an example of a very large graph that has a small number of highly connected nodes and many lesser-connected nodes. The data consists of a single file with ~130 million edges of the type articleID1->articleID2


= Developer's Guide =

Developers should :
  * Download the software from SVN
  * Run the Ant build script
  * Download the wikipedia test data file
  * Amend the config/graphBeans.xml settings to work with the correct settings.


= Results so far =
The following databases have been trialled
  * OrientDB 0.9.25
  * Neo4j
  * InfiniteGraph (failed to get licensing software to work)
