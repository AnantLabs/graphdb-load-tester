#summary A guide for developers using the framework

= Preparing the test environment =
This package does *not* include the Wikipedia link dataset which is ~1GB of zipped content. 
The ant build.xml file should automatically download the appropriate data file before running the tests.

= Configuring different test scenarios =
The Spring configuration file contains different choices for configurations of graph loading services.
The choices of graph database are currently:
 * Neo4j 1.3M02
 * OrientDB 0.9.25

Each graph database also needs an indexing service. The OrientDB service currently uses it's own indexing service but Neo4j can use a choice of the provided indexing services based on:
 * BerkeleyDB 
 * Lucene-based service.

At the time of writing none of these configurations are capable of loading the test data on Windows 32 bit JVM or on Mac OSX with 2GB RAM.
